description: Sets up an `## Agent skills` block in AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md and `docs/agents/` so the engineering skills know this repo's issue tracker, domain doc layout, and current agent-entrypoint strategy. Run before first use of `to-issues`, `to-prd`, `triage`, `diagnose`, `tdd`, `improve-codebase-architecture`, or `zoom-out` — or if those skills appear to be missing repo-specific guidance.

# Setup Matt Pocock's Skills

Scaffold the per-repo configuration that the engineering skills assume:

- **Issue tracker** — where issues live (GitHub by default; local markdown is also supported out of the box)
- **Domain docs** — where `CONTEXT.md` and ADRs live, and the consumer rules for reading them
- **Agent entrypoints** — whether one file is canonical yet, or whether the repo is still intentionally supporting multiple agent entrypoints

This is a prompt-driven skill, not a deterministic script. Explore, present what you found, confirm with the user, then write.

## Process

### 1. Explore

Look at the current repo to understand its starting state. Read whatever exists; don't assume:

- `git remote -v` and `.git/config` — is this a GitHub repo? Which one?
- `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root — does either exist? Is there already an `## Agent skills` section in either?
- `CONTEXT.md` and `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the repo root
- `docs/adr/` and any `src/*/docs/adr/` directories
- `docs/agents/` — does this skill's prior output already exist?
- `.scratch/` — sign that a local-markdown issue tracker convention is already in use

### 2. Present findings and ask

Summarise what's present and what's missing. Then walk the user through the three decisions **one at a time** — present a section, get the user's answer, then move to the next. Don't dump all three at once.

Assume the user does not know what these terms mean. Each section starts with a short explainer (what it is, why these skills need it, what changes if they pick differently). Then show the choices and the default.

**Section A — Issue tracker.**

> Explainer: The "issue tracker" is where issues live for this repo. Skills like `to-issues`, `triage`, `to-prd`, and `qa` read from and write to it — they need to know whether to call `gh issue create`, write a markdown file under `.scratch/`, or follow some other workflow you describe. Pick the place you actually track work for this repo.

Default posture: these skills were designed for GitHub. If a `git remote` points at GitHub, propose that. If a `git remote` points at GitLab (`gitlab.com` or a self-hosted host), propose GitLab. Otherwise (or if the user prefers), offer:

- **GitHub** — issues live in the repo's GitHub Issues (uses the `gh` CLI)
- **GitLab** — issues live in the repo's GitLab Issues (uses the [`glab`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli) CLI)
- **Local markdown** — issues live as files under `.scratch/<feature>/` in this repo (good for solo projects or repos without a remote)
- **Other** (Jira, Linear, etc.) — ask the user to describe the workflow in one paragraph; the skill will record it as freeform prose

**Section B — Domain docs.**

> Explainer: Some skills (`improve-codebase-architecture`, `diagnose`, `tdd`) read a `CONTEXT.md` file to learn the project's domain language, and `docs/adr/` for past architectural decisions. They need to know whether the repo has one global context or multiple (e.g. a monorepo with separate frontend/backend contexts) so they look in the right place.

Confirm the layout:

- **Single-context** — one `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root. Most repos are this.
- **Multi-context** — `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the root pointing to per-context `CONTEXT.md` files (typically a monorepo).

**Section C — Agent entrypoints.**

> Explainer: Some repos keep one canonical agent entrypoint file. Others are temporarily testing multiple agents and want both entrypoint files to stay aligned while shared guidance moves into `docs/agents/`. The skills need to know which posture applies so they do not accidentally create or privilege the wrong file.

Confirm the repo's current rule:

- **Canonical file** — one of `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` is authoritative.
- **Dual-entrypoint trial** — both files stay aligned at a high level, with shared durable guidance moved into `docs/agents/`.

### 3. Confirm and edit

Show the user a draft of:

- The `## Agent skills` block to add to the repo entrypoint file or files
- The contents of `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`, `docs/agents/domain.md`, `docs/agents/agent-files.md`

Let them edit before writing.

### 4. Write

**Pick the file to edit:**

- If the repo is in a dual-entrypoint trial and both `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` exist, update both with the same short navigational block.
- Else if `CLAUDE.md` exists, edit it.
- Else if `AGENTS.md` exists, edit it.
- If neither exists, ask the user which one to create — don't pick for them.

Never create a second entrypoint file unless the user explicitly wants a dual-entrypoint setup.

If an `## Agent skills` block already exists in the chosen file, update its contents in-place rather than appending a duplicate. Don't overwrite user edits to the surrounding sections.

The block:

```markdown
## Agent skills

Repo-specific agent guidance lives in `docs/agents/`.

- Issue tracker workflow: see `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`
- Domain-document entrypoints: see `docs/agents/domain.md`
- Agent-file handling: see `docs/agents/agent-files.md`
```

Then write the docs files using the seed templates in this skill folder as a starting point:

- [issue-tracker-github.md](./issue-tracker-github.md) — GitHub issue tracker
- [issue-tracker-gitlab.md](./issue-tracker-gitlab.md) — GitLab issue tracker
- [issue-tracker-local.md](./issue-tracker-local.md) — local-markdown issue tracker
- [domain.md](./domain.md) — domain doc consumer rules + layout

Write `docs/agents/agent-files.md` from scratch unless the repo already has an equivalent file.

For "other" issue trackers, write `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` from scratch using the user's description.

### 5. Done

Tell the user the setup is complete and which engineering skills will now read from these files. Mention they can edit `docs/agents/*.md` directly later — re-running this skill is only necessary if they want to switch issue trackers or restart from scratch.
